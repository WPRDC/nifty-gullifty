Nifty external (non-WPRDC) datasets and scripts for working with them

This repository is for datasets that could be useful to WPRDC users, for instance, datasets that include useful data about the Pittsburgh area or datasets that are complementary to those on [the WPRDC data portal](https://data.wprdc.org).

## Datasets/analyses relevant to Western Pennsylvania

- [mikelor/TsaThroughput](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput) - A CSV file counting the number of TSA screenings each hour, at each US airport. We wrote a [script for extracting just the data relevant to the three Pittsburgh airport screening locations](https://github.com/WPRDC/nifty-gullifty/blob/x/extract_pit_tsa_screenings.py).
- [colindean/wilkinsburg_pittsburgh_merger_analysis/blob/main/tax_rate_comparison/retrieve_tax_rates.py](https://github.com/colindean/wilkinsburg_pittsburgh_merger_analysis/blob/main/tax_rate_comparison/retrieve_tax_rates.py) - Python script to scrape millage tax rates for municipalities and school districts in Allegheny County from [https://apps.alleghenycounty.us/website/MillMuni.asp](https://apps.alleghenycounty.us/website/MillMuni.asp).

## Just really interesting data

- [Seattle Public Library checkout records](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6/data) - Anonymized checkout-level records of books and other media checked out from the Seattle Public Library. According to [this article about the unavailability of book sales data](https://www.publicbooks.org/where-is-all-the-book-data/), the Seattle Public Library is one of the few institutions to release such data, giving a peek into what people are actually reading/consuming.
