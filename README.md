Nifty external (non-WPRDC) datasets and scripts for working with them

This repository is for datasets that could be useful to WPRDC users, for instance, datasets that include useful data about the Pittsburgh area or datasets that are complementary to those on [the WPRDC data portal](https://data.wprdc.org).

- [mikelor/TsaThroughput](https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput) - A CSV file counting the number of TSA screenings each hour, at each US airport. We wrote a [script for extracting just the data relevant to the three Pittsburgh airport screening locations](https://github.com/WPRDC/nifty-gullifty/blob/x/extract_pit_tsa_screenings.py).
- [colindean/wilkinsburg_pittsburgh_merger_analysis/blob/main/tax_rate_comparison/retrieve_tax_rates.py](https://github.com/colindean/wilkinsburg_pittsburgh_merger_analysis/blob/main/tax_rate_comparison/retrieve_tax_rates.py) - Python script to scrape millage tax rates for municipalities and school districts in Allegheny County from [https://apps.alleghenycounty.us/website/MillMuni.asp](https://apps.alleghenycounty.us/website/MillMuni.asp).
