# From Jeremy Singer-Vine's Data Is Plural â€” 2021.05.12 edition:
# "TSA screenings. In its FOIA reading room, the US Transportation
# Security Administration publishes weekly PDF files that indicate
# the number of people passing through its checkpoints, broken down
# by hour and location. IT specialist Mike Lorengo has been converting
# these PDFs into structured data files.
# https://github.com/mikelor/TsaThroughput

# The format is currently 721 columns wide, and there are only three
# that have information specifically about the Pittsburgh airport.
# This script extracts just the data of interest.
